✨ Data Structure Visualizer

A fun and interactive way to SEE how data structures work!
🌟 About the Project

This project is a pure C++ console-based application that helps you visualize popular data structures with simple ASCII graphics. No CSS, no frameworks — just raw C++ and creativity!
🎯 Features

✔️ Stack → Like plates stacked one on top of another.
✔️ Queue → A real-world waiting line simulation.
✔️ Linked List → Nodes connected with pointers.
✔️ Interactive → Insert, delete, and see the magic happen in real time!
